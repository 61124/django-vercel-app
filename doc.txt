✅ Prerequisites
Python (3.8 or higher)
Django (5.x)
Gmail account for sending emails
Bootstrap for UI
🧱 Project Setup
Install Django using pip install django.
Create a new Django project using django-admin startproject support_system.
Navigate to the project directory using cd support_system.
Create a Django app using python manage.py startapp support.
Add the app to INSTALLED_APPS in the settings.py file.
📧 Configure Email Settings
Enable 2-Step Verification in your Google Account.
Generate an App Password by selecting Mail as the app type and providing a name.
Copy the 16-character App Password.
In settings.py, configure email settings using your Gmail address and the generated App Password.
📦 Create the Model
Define a SupportTicket model with fields for name, email, subject, message, status, and created_at timestamp.
Apply migrations using python manage.py makemigrations and python manage.py migrate.
📝 Create the Form
Create a SupportForm using Django's ModelForm.
Use it to capture user input for support ticket submissions.
🛎 Create Views
Define a submit_ticket view that handles GET and POST requests.
On form submission, save the ticket and send an email notification using send_mail().
Render a success page on successful submission.
🚦 Configure URLs
Create a urls.py file in the app directory.
Define a URL path for submitting support tickets and map it to the view.
Include the app’s URLs in the project's main urls.py file.
🎨 Create Templates
Create a templates/support folder.
Add submit_ticket.html for the support form using Bootstrap for styling.
Add success.html for displaying the confirmation message.
🧪 Run the Project
Start the development server using python manage.py runserver.
Access the application at http://localhost:8000/submit/.
Fill out and submit the form.
Check the Gmail inbox of the support team for the email notification.
For admin panel use http://localhost:8000/admin/
